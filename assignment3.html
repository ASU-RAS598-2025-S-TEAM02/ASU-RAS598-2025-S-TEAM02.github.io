            <h3>Discussion 1</h3>
            <p>Forward and backward convolution cannot be implemented in real-time streaming
                applications because it requires future input samples that haven't occurred yet. This technique
                creates zero-phase filters by applying the filter twice - once forward and once backward - 
                which necessitates having the complete dataset available before processing begins. In real-time 
                applications, we can only use causal filters that operate solely on present and past samples, 
                making backward filtering impossible.</p>

            <h3>Discussion 2</h3>
            <p>As the window size of an FIR filter grows, several important changes occur in the filtered
                data's profile: the transition band narrows, creating a steeper transition between passband and
                stopband, which makes the filter more selective and closer to an ideal "brick wall" response.
                This narrowing also decreases the main lobe width of the frequency response, enabling better
                frequency resolution, particularly for closely spaced components. Longer filters can better
                depict longer wavelengths, improving resolution of lower frequencies. Overall, the filter
                response more closely approximates the ideal desired response, with smaller deviations from
                the target frequency characteristics. These improvements collectively enhance the filter's
                ability to precisely separate and process different frequency components in the input signal.</p>

            <h3>Discussion 3</h3>
            <p>FIR filters require the time series to be truncated by N (filter size) since:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The convolution process requires N input samples to produce the first valid output</li>
                <li>The first N-1 outputs are contaminated with startup transients and do not exhibit steady-state behavior</li>
                <li>In linear-phase filters, this introduces a (N-1)/2 sample delay</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Disadvantages of Larger Filter Sizes</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Data loss: Extra samples need to be discarded at the beginning/end of your data</li>
                <li>Increased storage latency: More filters lead to greater processing time</li>
                <li>Increased cost of computation: N multiply-accumulate operations are needed for each output</li>
                <li>Increased memory requirement: More space needed for coefficients and history of samples</li>
                <li>Additional settling time: Filter takes longer time to settle into steady-state behavior</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These compromises set up an intrinsic trade-off between frequency resolution and
                implementation problems like processing time and storage space.</p>
